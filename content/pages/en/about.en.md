## Technical details

This website was created with the React-Framework [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/ "Learn GatsbyJS").
The website is currently hosted on Amazon S3 and provided via Cloudflare CDN.

In addition, for a few components, such as the [View-Counter](https://github.com/DaTurboD/GIS-Netzwerk/tree/master/src/components/articles/viewcounter "ViewCounter") or the [Post-Reactions](https://github.com/DaTurboD/GIS-Netzwerk/tree/master/src/components/articles/postreactions "Post-Reactions") [Google Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com  "Google FIrebase") or Cloud Firestore are used.

With around 10,000 page views per month, the cost of S3 hosting is around â‚¬0.10 (mainly due to frequent changes to the website) per month. 
Since the limits for the free content on Google Firebase are not reached, there are no costs and Cloudflare is also offered free of charge.
The page is deployed via [GatsbyCloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/ "GatsbyCloud") ðŸŽ‰.
