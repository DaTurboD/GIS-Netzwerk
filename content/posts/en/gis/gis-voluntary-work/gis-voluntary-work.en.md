[GIS](/en/gis/geographic-information-system-what-is-gis "What is GIS?") Volunteering offers a good opportunity to develop personally and professionally.

You can also get involved in a good cause. You can later pack the projects into a pretty portfolio and thus stand out from the competition with extra points when applying.

What's even better is that you can join these organizations with a PC at home and don't have to travel the world.

### How to join

There are many different ways to contribute to OpenStreetMap, from reporting small errors on the map, completing existing data, drawing new buildings from aerial photographs and recording routes and points of interest with the GPS device. Our instructions will help you use the right programs and enter data. (OpenStreetMap).
